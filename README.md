# Automated-risk-management
This project has as goal to have a predefined stoploss and execute ordered if condition are satisfied

•	After attaining a fundamental predisposition of the security, the script computes in python the ATR and workout my Risk/Reward. The script would through a class (OOP) would initiate the buy and one stop limit order through API socket.
•	If the first stop loss were triggered, the second would be placed and a buy limit at pre-defined level for resizing.
•	This algorithm achieves lower opportunity cost for mistiming the trade, but there is an asymmetric trade-off between the opportunity cost and the transaction cost.
